## Housing Price Predictor

#### This is a Node.js app that uses a Python machine learning script to create predictions for house values

### Deploy the app -> Input values -> get predictions for house values

To deploy the app run:

```$ nodemon app.js```

**In this repo:**

1. housing.py -> a machine learning algorithm for predicting housing prices

2. housing_data.csv -> a csv with.....housing data!

3. A Node.js app for deploying the ML algorithm into production

Here's an architecture overview for how the final app works:
